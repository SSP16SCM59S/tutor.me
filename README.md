# Project Proposal

`Zsolt Pazmandy [ID: 1600690] MSc Computer Science Summer Project 2016`

## Introduction

The project aims to create a learning platform that links inquisitive individuals wishing to learn something with capable trainers ready to help them. It is an easy-to-use mobile application with a continuously growing, extensible, community-maintained library of subjects to laren. The purpose of the project is not to design specific curricula or to force a certain methodology on its users. Rather, it is a means of creating and delivering any learning material the community finds worthy of teaching. For the trainers of the community, it is a tutoring tool; for its learners it is a source of knowledge and access to people who other than being proficient in certain subjects, often have invaluable practical experience, too.
